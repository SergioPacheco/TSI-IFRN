# Calling example
This example shows how to call other COBOL programs from programs. The calling is same for external programs as well as nested programs.
Make sure that the called programs are in libraries on your library list.
There are re two examples:
 - NESTEDCALL.CBBLE - shows that COBOL programs can be nested into one and how to call them
 - CALLER.CBLLE - shows how to call outside programs, calls HERON.CBLLE
